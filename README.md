Elements ID
------------------

R is the ID for Resistor

C is the ID for Capacitor

L is the ID for Inductor

I is the ID for InDependent cs

V is the ID for InDependent vs

F is the ID for cccs

H is the ID for ccvs

G is the ID for vccs

E is the ID for vcvs

-In any current source: the node at the arrow's tail is ('node1') in the netlist, and the node at the arrow's head is ('node2')  (i.e. a positive current flows into node1 and out of node2.)

-In any Voltage source: ('node1') is the positive node to be written in the netlist and ('node2') is the negative one

-But for the ccvs ('H') : ('node1') is the negative node to be written in the netlist and ('node2') is the positive one


-If you have in your circuit more than one current controlled source that depends on the same current, you shall write at the end of these sources 'repeated' except for the first one
